        ##I.   Introduction
~- ~- ~- ~- ~- ~- ~- ~- ~- ~- ~- ~- ~- ~- ~- ~-

The purpose of this FAQ is to detail each of the dungeons
in Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky.  This FAQ
is not meant to be a walkthrough.  There are other FAQs
for that. This FAQ contains several bits of data for each
dungeon, such as the pokemon and items found in the dungeon.
I collected this data from analyzing this game's internal data
myself (with help from nhahtdh), and organized the data into this FAQ.

        ##II.   Format for Dungeon Information
~- ~- ~- ~- ~- ~- ~- ~- ~- ~- ~- ~- ~- ~- ~- ~-
NOTE: For some of these sections, information on the Boss Floors and Warp
Floors will be included along with the other floors.  Usually, this
information is Not Applicable and can simply be ignored.  Item lists
for Boss Floors and Warp Floor may influence what the Pickup ability
can get on those floors, if it succeeds.  I haven't checked this.

NOTE 2: For items found in treasure boxes on warp floors, I will have
no information, except in some cases.

NUMBER##. NAME OF DUNGEON
Requirements
# of floors within the dungeon
Special conditions of the dungeon and other unique information

*----General Info----*
Contained under this heading is Floor size, special tiles in
the dungeon such as water, weather, and other information. I also
mention if there are kecleon markets, monster houses, or buried
items in this dungeon. If there are Secret Bazaars in the dungeon, I will
mention the item list for Swalot's Shop.
This section also includes several other bits of information extracted
from the game, such as these:

Turn Limit: The maximum number of turns you may spend on a floor of the
dungeon before getting shoved out of the dungeon by an unknown force.

Rescue Mission Ranking:  This is the rank of any regular SOS rescue missions
or regular rescue missions for each floor of the dungeon.  This ranking
determines the kind of items you can get from treasure boxes that are dropped
by defeated enemies.  See the Misc. Information Section for more info on this.
Special thanks to Evie for providing this information for most of the game's
dungeons.

Floor Layout: The floor layouts for each floor of the dungeon.  These are the
possible floor configurations:    (# horizontal x # vertical)
-Small: Small floor with some rooms. (Biggest observed room layout: 2 x 3)
-Small-Medium #1: Fairly small floor with few rooms. (Biggest observed room
                  layout: 4 x 3)
-Small-Medium #2: Fairly small floor with few rooms. (Biggest observed room
                  layout: 3 x 3)
-Medium-Large #1: Floor Size varies and can have many rooms. (Biggest observed
                  room layout: 6 x 4)
-Medium-Large #2: Floor Size varies and can have many rooms. (Biggest observed
                  room layout: 6 x 4)
-Medium-Large #3: Floor Size varies and can have many rooms. (Biggest observed
                  room layout: 6 x 4)
-Medium-Large #4: Floor Size varies and can have many rooms. (Biggest observed
                  room layout: 6 x 4)
-Medium-Large #5: Floor Size varies and can have many rooms. (Biggest observed
                  room layout: 6 x 4)
-Outer-Square: 8 Rooms in middle of floor, surrounded by a long hallway on all
               sides.
-Crossroads: 3 Rooms at the top & bottom of floor and 2 rooms at the left and
             right side of the floor, all connected together by hallways in
             the middle of the floor.
-Line: 1 horizontal row of about 5 rooms.
-Cross: 5 Rooms arranged in a cross (1 west, 1 east, 1 north, 1 south, & 1
        center)
-Beetle: A giant room in the middle of the map that connects to a vertical-row
         of 3 rooms on its left side and also on its right side.

Room Density: This influences the # of rooms on the floor.  The higher the
value, the more rooms that can appear on the floor.  However, be aware that
the Floor Layout and Hallway Length also influence how many rooms can appear
on the floor.

Hallway Length: This influences how long the hallways on the floor can be.
This may also influence the total floor size as well.

Hallway Density: This influences the # of extra room-connecting hallways and
dead-end hallways that will be on the floor.  The higher the value, the more
hallways to travel through.

Water Density: This influences how much of the floor will be covered in water.
This is only applicable to dungeons with water/lava/etc.  The higher the
value, the more water you can expect to see.  Be aware that a value of 0 does
not necessarily mean that there is no water on the floor.

Coin Max:  The Coins you find on the floor will not have a value
higher than the Coin Max.  Coins are assigned a random value below
the Coin Max when it spawns on the floor.

Densities for Items/Traps/Pokemon/Buried Items:  These influence the
# of Items/Traps/etc that initially spawn on the floor.  It appears
the floor will not spawn more than Density + 1.  However, the floor
can very well spawn less than the Density as well, usually Density - 1.

Percentages for Kecleon Shops/Monster Houses:  The given percentage
is the chance that a kecleon shop or monster house will appear on that
floor.

Percentages for Hidden Stairs:  The given percentage is the chance that
Hidden Stairs will appear on that floor.  It seems that Hidden Stairs
will never appear on the last floor of a dungeon.  In Multiple part
dungeons, Hidden Stairs will not appear on the last floor of any single
part of that dungeon, such as SP1 Floor 3 of Shaymin Village.

Percentages for Sticky Items:  The given percentage is the chance for
any regular spawned item, kecleon shop item, monster house item, or buried
item to be sticky.

Darkness:  I will include how dark the dungeon is.  Dungeons with Light
Darkness allow the player to see enemies up to 2 squares away while in
hallways.  Dungeons with Heavy Darkness only allow the player to see
enemies up to 1 square away while in hallways.

Water:  I will specify which floors of the dungeon may have water in them.
Some later dungeons that are stated to have water may actually have void or
lava in them, as I didn't check most of the non-story post-ending dungeons.

Water-Rooms: Some floors have a chance of having 1 or more water rooms.  Each
room on the floor has a chance of being a water room.  I will specify that
percentage chance.  Water Rooms include water-maze rooms, mid-puddle rooms,
water-halved rooms, & water-square rooms.  Water-square rooms have a 2x2 set
of tiles surrounded by water in the center of the room that can have up to 3
extra items in it.  The top left tile of that water-square is always a Warp
Trap.  I will include this only for the dungeons in which this applies.

IQ-Booster Bonus:  I will specify which floors of a dungeon grant an IQ
boost to a pokemon that enters the floor holding the IQ Booster item.  The
IQ gained is equal to 1 IQv. (5 IQvs = 1 Favorite Gummi)

Enemy IQ:  In later dungeons, enemies will gain IQ skills.  This
details the IQv of the pokemon found on every floor.  Pokemon found
in pre-ending dungeons do not have access to the 4 or 5 default IQ skills of
their IQ group, regardless of their IQv.  To figure out how many IQ Stars the
IQv represents, simply use this formula:
                # of half stars = RoundDown[ ((IQv - 10) / 50) ] + 1

*----Pokemon----*
This heading contains information on the enemy pokemon found
in the dungeon, such as Name, Type, Level, Exp(hit by move), Floors
found on, and the base chance of recruiting them.  The positive recruitment
percentages only apply if you answered Yes to the "Played Darkness/Time?"
Question at the beginning of the game.  If you chose No, The positive
recruitment percentages are halved for some pokemon. The level listed for
each pokemon is the lowest level the pokemon is found on.  Pokemon levels
tend to increase by 1 as you go deeper into a dungeon, such as on Floors 6
and 10.  Each Pokemon Type is abreviated as follows:

Normal->NRM  Steel->STL  Fire->FIR  Bug->BUG  Electric->ELC
Poison->PSN  Grass->GRS  Dark->DRK  Ice->ICE  Fighting->FTG
Flying->FLY  Ghost->GHO  Rock->RCK            Psychic-->PSY
Dragon->DRG  Water->WTR
Ground->GRD

Some Pokemon may have special requirements for appearing.

*----Traps------*
Under this heading, you will find a list of all traps found in the
dungeon.  Wonder Tiles are included.

*----Items------*
This section contains specific information on the items found within
the dungeon.  This includes an organized list of every item found, an
exact percentage for the rarity for each item and item group, and rarity
of Coins found in the dungeon.  The lists are arranged in original game
format.

Some dungeon floors have items marked as Guaranteed.  These items will always
spawn on that floor, as far as I can tell.  I am currently not sure if the
Guaranteed keys on Zero Isle South and West have a chance of not appearing,
or if there is a chance of an additional Key appearing.  You'll know what I
mean when you notice on that floor that the OTHER category has an
Appearance %, but no actual items in the category.  That's just how the game
is coded.

I gathered most of this information by extracting it from the game itself.
This FAQ currently only includes the exact item lists of regular spawned
items, kecleon shops, monster houses, and buried items.  Other item
information will be included in a future update if I get this info.

Update:  This FAQ now contains the item lists for Swalot's Shop in Secret
Bazaars in each dungeon.

------Notes------
Just additional things I want to mention.

Notes:
+In these dungeons, wild enemies have no default IQ skills.  Unless
 otherwise indicated, enemies in these dungeons have an IQv of 1.
+Enemies cannot use or throw items they are holding.
+Enemies within the same dungeon are usually around the same level.
+While going through these dungeons, enemies increase in level by 1 on
 Floors 6, 10, 15, 20, etc.

+Few of these dungeons have traps.  Traps don't show up much in dungeons
 with traps in them.

+There are no buried items in these dungeons

+These dungeons can have kecleon shops, monster houses, & Swalot Shops
 (Secret Bazaar).  Here are the recurring item lists for these:

------Notes------
A small and easy dungeon.  Take a pleasant walk through here and enjoy the
sights.  Watch your step, though.  You wouldn't want to step on a trap or
into a monster house.  Try not to trip over the Iron Thorns on the ground.
Maybe not the most pleasant walk after all....

        Gabite Scale (Win Gabite Fight)

------Notes------
The only dungeon in the game where Gabite Scales are found.  You will fight
the Gabite boss every time you go through this dungeon and be rewarded if
you win.  His Level, Hp, and moves seem to vary slightly each time you
fight him.

Notes:
+In these dungeons, wild enemies have IQ skills now, like Bodyguard and
 Brick Tough.  After being recruited, their IQv is reset to 1.
+Enemies can now use or throw items they are holding, such as Reviver
 Seeds and Doom Seeds.
+Enemies vary largely in level now.  There will be weak low-level enemies
 mixed in with strong high-level enemies.
+While going through these dungeons, enemies increase in level on
 various floors.  Here is a list of the floors and how many levels the
 pokemon have gained by these floors.  (Special Thanks to kirby5790)

01F~05F = +0 Levels
06F~09F = +1 Levels
10F~14F = +2 Levels
15F~19F = +3 Levels
20F~24F = +4 Levels
25F~29F = +5 Levels
30F~39F = +6 Levels
40F~46F = +7 Levels
47F~49F = +8 Levels

+Traps will show up much more often and with quite a bit more variety.

+Quite a few new items can be found in these dungeons.
+Items picked up in these dungeons may be sticky.
+All these dungeons have buried items within walls. These items can be
 retrieved by Palkia(Absolute Mover), Rock Smashing, or using a One-Room
 Orb.  A Pokemon holding a Mobile Scarf or who can go through walls can
 also retrieve these items.  Some of these buried items are within walls
 lining hallways, so if you are sprinting through a hallway and suddenly
 stop for no apparent reason, there is a buried item near you.
+Some of these dungeons have Treasure Chambers on specific floors, which
 each require a key to open.

+There are various recurring kecleon markets, monster houses, & Swalot Shops
 (Secret Bazaar) in these dungeons.  Here they are:

------Notes------
The only dungeon you'll find Sky Gifts in.  If you manage to find any
Hidden Stairs here and get into a Secret Bazaar, you will love the items
that Swalot will be practically giving away.  Each 100 poke Grab Bag has
about a 10% chance of containing a Vitamin, Life Seed, Sitrus Berry, or
a Joy Seed.  You also have about a 12% chance of getting a gummi. Hope you
brought cash!

------Notes------
Prepare to starve.  This place is devoid of food.  Unless you stumble upon
a monster house full of gummies, your belly will descend fast, especially
while traversing the bigger floors found nearer to the end of this dungeon.
Even if you bring your own food items, the fairly frequent grimy traps will
turn those to junk.  Hold onto the Oran berries you find here, as you may
need them to keep yourself from fainting while your belly is empty.

Aside from the hunger problems, this dungeon has a fair selection of TMs and
Seeds.  You'll find many Orbs here, but not much variety.  The treasure
boxes that are dropped by enemies can be pretty decent on the higher
floors.

Lots of Throwing items here.  Orbs are plentiful, as usual.  The Warp Zone
deluxe boxes always have Reviver Seeds, so don't bother coming to this
dungeon for the deluxe boxes.  If you want Reviver Seeds, recycle some
Escape Orbs.  Much quicker.

------Notes------
Aegis Cave is not a fun place.  Each defeated Unown has an estimated 37%
chance to drop a special stone resembling that Unown, such as A-Stone or
F-Stone.  To complete the Ice, Rock, and Steel sections of Aegis Cave,
you must have in your inventory the Unown Stones that spell out your
section name at the giant stone found at the end of each section.  For
example, you need at least 1 I-Stone, 1 C-Stone, and 1 E-Stone to complete
Ice Aegis Cave.  The stones are used up after entering the next section,
so you'll spend time collecting those stones again if you ever come back
to Aegis Cave.
To save time, you may want to bring 1 or more high level Illuminators who
can endure hits from Unown, so that more Unown will spawn and getting the
stones won't take as long.  Transfer Orbs may help too.

This dungeon is an excellent place to gather items to recycle for tickets.
You can repeatedly enter any section of Aegis Cave until you fill up your
inventory with regular items and Unown stones won from defeated Unown.
Then you can head to Spinda's cafe and recycle those fairly useless Unown
stones away!

You'll find Berries all over the place.  You may stumble upon a few Reviver
Seeds as well, so keep an eye out for them.  If you look hard enough, you can
also find Keys in this dungeon.  Sure beats paying 8000 for each of them!

------Notes------
This dungeon can be tough.  Many strong pokemon reside here, and traps are
all over the place.  Two floors have a high chance of having a monster house
so watch it.  There are quite a few useful Orbs and other items here though.

------Notes------
An extremely good place to find gummies.  The Unique kecleon
shops here have gummies for every kind of pokemon.  You'll also get plenty
of Gummies and Gold Ribbons from Swalot's Grab Bags in Secret Bazaars in
this dungeon.  Hmm...Pay 100 for an item worth 2000?  Be glad Swalot is such
a bad businessman and rake in the cash!

------Notes------
One of the Dungeons with an Evo-Type Kecleon shop.  There is also a Unique
Kecleon Shop here that specializes in only 3 items.  The Swalot Grab Bags
in this dungeon's Secret Bazaars also have the same 3 items.  What immense
variety.  At least if you need gummies for your Aggron or Probopass, you
know where to look.

quite a few TMs and Seeds to be found as well.  In addition to the HMs,
some of the TMs here are unique to this dungeon.

There are some decent pokemon worth recruiting here.  If you are willing
to traverse all the way to floor 44, you can recruit pokemon at level 50
before even completing Blizzard Island.  Swinub, Phanphy, Bagon, and
Misdreavus are all decent pokemon with powerful evolved forms.

There are no annoying traps here, so enjoy a rather safe trip!

------Notes------
Welcome to Zero Isle North.  Like the other Zero Isles, you'll find plenty
of the best items of the game here.  You can bring items here, so prepare
before coming here.

This dungeon has rather low Item Densities for a Zero Isle.  However, North
makes up for it by having every 3rd floor have a 25% chance of having a
Kecleon Shop.  You'll see them pretty often, so bring lots of money before
entering this dungeon.  The Kecleon shops have some extremely awesome items.

Once you get to Floor 31, the Item density will increase and a larger
variety of items will appear.  Floors 31-75 are great spots for some
superb Orbs, such as One-Room Orbs & Stairs Orbs.

Enemies on the final 25 floors will drop treasure boxes that can contain
extremely good items. Bringing team members with the Collector IQ skill
can be good for getting lots of these boxes, assuming your inventory still
has space for them by that point.

Watch out for Monster Houses.  Some floors have a 30% chance of spawning one
of them, so be on your guard.

Enemies have extremely high IQ and range from level 50 to level 90, so be
ready for a challenge.

Traps are quite deadly.  There are numerous Stat-Reduction Traps and Item
Corruption Traps and no Wonder Tiles, so these traps will heavily influence
your survival.

If you've trained up a few level 100 pokemon with high stats, this place will
be a breeze, if you avoid the traps.

------Notes------
Welcome to Zero Isle East.  Like the other Zero Isles, you'll find plenty
of the best items of the game here.  Although your team will be set to level
1, you have the opportunity to bring 16 items, so prepare before coming here.

Zero Isle East has an Item Density of 6 throughout the entire dungeon,
making it the best Zero Isle to gather items in, unless you only want a
short 10-floor trip (ZIW & ZIS are good for short trips).

You'll find many Max Elixirs and TMs throughout the dungeon.  The Kecleon
Shops found here are pretty nice as well.  The Secret Bazaars here have
Swalot Grab Bags with a huge variety of possible items inside.

Happily, there are no Monster Houses in this dungeon! Hooray!

------Notes------
Welcome to Zero Isle West.  Like the other Zero Isles, you'll find plenty
of the best items of the game here.  Be sure to pick up the Key on floor 1.

Floors 1-8 have the highest Item Densities of the dungeon, so those are
good floors to search thoroughly for items.  Retrieving every item on these
8 floors gives you a decent shot at getting an Escape Orb.  Keep this in
mind if you want to make a short trip.

You'll find nearly as many TMs in this dungeon as you would in Treeshroud
Forest.

------Notes------
Ah, the great Zero Isle South.  Like the other Zero Isles, you'll see many
of the best items of the game here.  Be sure to pick up the Key on floor 1.
Also, be sure to explore floor 20 thoroughly, since there is a good chance
of finding an Escape Orb on that floor.

Floors 1-10 have the highest Item Densities of the dungeon, so those are
good floors to search thoroughly for items. Retrieving every item on these
10 floors gives you a pretty good shot at getting an Escape Orb.  Keep this
in mind if you want to make a short trip.

You'll find as many TMs in this dungeon as you would in Treeshroud Forest.
If only there was a pokemon who could learn them all....*coughMEWcough*

Several floors have a 50% chance of having a kecleon shop, so looking for
one on those floors isn't a bad idea.  However, since you are very likely
lacking in money, get used to stealing from them.  Heh, good luck trying
to get a Goggle Specs or Tight Belt.  Those goodies are on the highest
floors of this dungeon...in kecleon shops.  Not easy prizes.

This dungeon is not lacking in difficulties.  Enemies are always tough.
Once you have reached Floor 51, expect to see even more enemies and traps
than previously.  Enemies will also start getting dangerously intelligent
after floor 40, so be ready for that too.  Some floors have a 50% chance
of having a monster house on it, so don't stick around on those floors for
too long.

Here is a list of pokemon that I have heard are fairly good at Zero Isle
South:
Smoochum (Forewarn ability; Room-Range Powder Snow; Excellent Movepool)
Regigigas (Excellent early stats; Great Movepool; Bad Ability)
Mew (High hp; Learns every TM in the game)
Sableye (Good early Stats; Good Movepool; No Weaknesses)
Lucario (8-Tile Range Dark Pulse; Many Resistances)
Lapras (Ok early Stats; Sleep-Move Sing; Decent Movepool)
Granbull (Great early Stats; Great Movepool)
Porygon (Good early stats; Good Abilities; ATK-Up Sharpen)
Ursarang (Ok early Stats; Good Abilities; Multi-hit Fury Swipes)
Octillery (Ok early Stats; Versatile Movepool; Multiple Ranged Moves)
Starmie (Extremely Pathetic Stats; Horrible Ability; Healing-Move Recover)
Solrock (Great defensive Stats; Good Ability; High-PP Movepool)
Stunky (Good early Stats; Good Ability; Multi-hit Fury Swipes)
Charizard (Poor LV 1 Stats; Good Stat-growth; Smokescreen; Great Movepool)
Weezing (Great defensive Stats; Good Ability; Smokescreen; Ok Movepool)

------Notes------
Welcome to Zero Isle Center.  Unlike the other Zero Isles, this dungeon does
not have any awesome vitamins and berries just lying around.  In fact, this
dungeon doesn't really appear to have any neat items lying around.  This
dungeon is basically Zero Isle North with its extra 25 floors and awesome
items traded for an insane spike in difficulty.

The first thing you'll notice here is the incredibly high level pokemon to be
found.  The highest levels found in any dungeon in the game, these pokemon
start at level 90, and quickly reach level 99.  Though, there are some
pathetic level 5 pokemon on some of these floors.  Apparently they just
wandered in from Marine Resort or something.

Next is the incredible amount of traps to be found.  It's bad enough that
you can't see the traps after attacking them, but most of the floors have
around 15 of them!  To make matters worse, two of the most common traps are
also new evil traps unseen in Time/Darkness.  Random Trap randomly chooses
a different trap and then has that trap affect your entire party!  Grudge
Trap is even worse.  It spawns some enemies near you with the Grudge Status,
so that if you defeat those enemies with a move, that move loses all its
PP.  Not too bad right?  Did I mention that every enemy on the floor also
gets the Grudge Status, and this Grudge Status never wears off?  Again, you
are not gonna like tripping a Grudge Trap, because beating lv 90-99 enemies,
who can still use moves, with a regular attack is not gonna be fun.  Stepping
on a Random Trap that mimics the Grudge Trap is basically a game over in
itself.  I recommend bringing a Goggle Specs for this dungeon.

Finally, there is Heavy Darkness on every floor.  Yep, you get to navigate
through hordes of Uber-powerful enemies, dozens of deadly traps, and the
frequent monster houses all while you can't see what's two steps in front of
you.  Have fun!

The only good thing about this dungeon is the excellent treasure boxes
dropped by enemies here.  Since most of the other items in this dungeon
are not worth collecting, you can stock up on these treasure boxes before
leaving this dungeon.  If you really want to try to collect a bunch of
these treasure boxes, you can enter the dungeon with a team of Collectors
and an escape orb.  Then just head to floor 2 and start grabbing up as
many boxes as you can hold before escaping the dungeon.  As long as your
team is strong enough, you might be able to get some decent loot out of this
dungeon.

You'll find 4 Deluxe Boxes at the final floor.  From what I've heard, these
Deluxe Boxes have Pokemon-Specific Items for the pokemon you used to reach
the end of this dungeon, although I have not confirmed this myself.

------Notes------
Welcome to Destiny Tower.  This dungeon is basically Zero Isle South with a
few differences.  For one thing, you can't be rescued in this dungeon.  You
also have to now worry about the same annoying new traps that were in Zero
Isle Center.  Most of the stuff I mentioned in the Zero Isle South Notes
apply here.  However, be aware that you cannot find TMs in this dungeon,
except in Kecleon Shops (where you will not have enough money to buy them),
so you will be fully dependent on the moves your leader naturally learns via
leveling up, unless you hope to steal some TMs.  This also makes Mew a bad
choice to bring here.

Of course, this insane challenge wouldn't be complete without you being
practically blindfolded by the Heavy Darkness of every floor.

The Kecleon Shops here can have a variety of items, including HMs.  There
are also unique monster houses here that contain Orbs and Gummies.

For reaching the end of this dungeon, you are rewarded with the Space Globe,
which is an equippable item that boosts the power of the user's moves by
150%.

------Notes------
A fairly tough dungeon with some slightly difficult restrictions.  Be sure
to bring Reviver Seeds.  This is a decent place to train in, and you might
even stumble upon Joy Seeds on the later floors.  There are some nice
Kecleon Shops here as well, although you will probably have to steal the good
stuff.

------Notes------
A fairly tough dungeon with some slightly difficult restrictions.  Be sure
to bring Reviver Seeds.  This is a decent place to train in, and you might
even stumble upon Joy Seeds on the later floors.  There are some good
Kecleon Shops here as well although you will probably have to steal the good
stuff.

The Deluxe Box at the end of the dungeon holds a pokemon-specific item for
your Leader or a Wonder Gummi.

------Notes------
A fairly tough dungeon with some slightly difficult restrictions.  Be sure
to bring Reviver Seeds.  This is a decent place to train in, and you might
even stumble upon Joy Seeds on the later floors.  Very nice Kecleon Shops
here as well.  The Swalot Grab Bags in the Secret Bazaars in this dungeon
have quite a variety of items, including frequent TMs.

The pokemon here can be quite annoying.  You'll get Screeched often and
occasionally even Metal Sounded by Magnemite, which can easily lead to being
KOed by an enemy attack, so be on your guard.

One of the 3 Deluxe Boxes at the end of the dungeon holds a pokemon-specific
item for your Leader.

------Notes------
A fairly tough dungeon with some slightly difficult restrictions.  Be sure
to bring Reviver Seeds.  This is a decent place to train in, and you might
even stumble upon Joy Seeds on the later floors.  Some good Kecleon Shops
here as well.  Swalot Grab Bags in Secret Bazaars have quite a bit of item
variety.

The Warp Zone floor has a deluxe box with an IQ booster inside.
Thanks to Sydney for confirming this.

        Aqua-Monica       (Defeat Kyogre)

------Notes------
Very strong enemies here, so be careful.  Nice place to train your tough
pokemon, though.

The Floor before Kyogre is loaded with TMs.  Perhaps bringing some Itemizer
Orbs and pokemon with the Pick-up ability to that floor might not be a bad
idea.

------Notes------
You get Special Episode 1 right after completing Chapter 3, so the stuff in
this dungeon actually is quite useful at that point in the story.  As long as
you don't mind being Bidoof, you can continually keep replaying this Episode.

The Coins here are quite high in value compared to dungeons like Mt. Bristle.
This is also a good place to gather up useful items like Reviver Seeds and
Totter Seeds.  This is also the first dungeon in which you can find HOLD items,
if you haven't unlocked Waterfall Cave yet.  This dungeon will also allow
you to stock up on Weather ORBS way before you would be able to get them in the
regular story.

However, this dungeon truly shines in its Kecleon Shops and Monster Houses.
Early floors of this dungeon have insanely high Kecleon Shop appearance rates.
Most of those early Kecleon Shops sell only ORBS, but since they are cheap,
you don't have to risk stealing them.  The Kecleon shops that appear on later
floors are much less common, but have extremely good items that you normally
wouldn't be able to get until way after Chapter 16.  You can find Heal Ribbons,
TMs, and even Sitrus Berries and Life Seeds!  However, due to how expensive
these items are, you likely would have no choice but to risk stealing them at
this point in the game.

The monster houses of this dungeon can also have various TMs and ORBS that
wouldn't normally be available to you until much later in the story.

------Notes------
Pretty much the same items as every other Special Episode dungeon.
This dungeon is odd in that the game only uses 4 Floors of this 16-Floor
Dungeon.  Or, at least it only let ME go through the first 4 Floors before
going to the next cut scene.  I've included all 16 Floors, incase my game
is glitched or something.

       | E.  Treasure Boxes and Mission Item Lists |
        --------------------------------------------
~Special Thanks to TT20 for discovering the following regarding Treasure Boxes~
[All percentages below are estimations and not the actual values]

When you or one of your allies defeat an enemy in a dungeon, there is around
a 2% chance that enemy will drop a Treasure Box (11% with Collector IQ skill).
The Box may contain 2 different kinds of items:
1. A 1* Species Item.  This appears around 60% of the time.  If the defeated
   enemy that dropped the box has its own line of 1* Species items, there is
   at least a 50% chance that the Species item in the box will be of its line,
   assuming the box does indeed contain a Species Item.
2. A Mission Reward Item.  This appears around 40% of the time.  The Item is
   randomly chosen from the Mission Rank Item List for that floor.  The
   Mission Rank is the rank of a regular rescue mission or SOS rescue mission
   done on that floor.

For example, here is the Mission Rank for each floor of Marine Resort:
Floor  1       E
Floors 2-4     *2
Floors 5-9     *3
Floors 10-18   *4

Boxes that enemies on floors 10-18 drop could contain items that you would
get as rewards for doing *4 Rank Jobs.

For most ingame dungeons, you can determine a dungeon floor's Rescue rank by
checking a non-escort Rescue Job for that floor.  Do not use Find Item Jobs to
determine the Rescue Rank of floors, since those jobs may or may not be 1 rank
higher than the Rescue Rank.  However, Escort and Arrest Jobs definitely have
a rank that is 1 rank higher than the Rescue Rank, so you can use those to
determine Rescue Rank by subtracting 1 rank from those.  Also, be aware
that Floor 1 always is E rank, regardless of the dungeon, though some of
the dungeons new to Sky version do not follow this rule.

Beach Cave is the only dungeon with Rescue Rank E on every floor.  Blizzard
Island is a good early post-ending dungeon for getting high value treasure
boxes from defeated enemies, though Zero Isle Centre is definitely the
best location for gathering treasure boxes.

Here are the Mission Rank Reward Item Lists.  Ranks *8 & *9 are not fully
confirmed, and may actually be eachother's item lists.  However, I am 90% sure
this is not the case.

        ##VIII.      Questions and Answers
~- ~- ~- ~- ~- ~- ~- ~- ~- ~- ~- ~- ~- ~- ~- ~-

Q: What is the best dungeon to train at before the game's ending?
A: Early on, train on the 4th and 5th floors of training mazes in Marowak's
   Dojo. Once you have completed Amp Plains and chapter 10, just train in
   any story dungeon that comes afterward.  However, Dragon Maze(Floors 3-5)
   in Marowak's Dojo remains one of the highest exp-yielding loc-ations, so
   feel free to continue training there.

Q: I need a lot of exp and fast! Any advice?
A: If you are still in the pre-ending, see the previous question.  However,
   If you are in the post-ending, there is a very easy method to gain tons of
   exp.  Remember those Rollcall Orbs that have been collecting dust in your
   storage?  Imagine if you could turn every one of those Rollcall Orbs into
   a monster house full of exp! How, you ask? Just follow these 10 easy steps!
   1. Make at least 1 pokemon of your team a pokemon with the Illuminate
      ability (Staryu, Chinchou, Volbeat, etc.).
   2. Make sure 1 of your pokemon has a room range damaging move, such as
      Discharge, Silver Wind, etc. Link it with another move.
   3. Add 1 or more rollcall orbs to your inventory.
   4. Enter any post-ending dungeon, excluding the zero isles.
   5. Find a low level enemy and lead it to a fairly big room on the floor.
   6. Disable all of your Illuminator's moves, and position him near the low
      level enemy.
   7. Allow the enemy to continue attacking your Illuminator until it stops
      blinking.
   8. Then position yourself near the low level enemy and throw a Rollcall Orb
      at that enemy.
   9. The enemy will then proceed to use that Rollcall Orb to warp every other
      enemy on the floor into the same room as your group.
   10.Wipe the room clean using your room-range move. Enjoy the experience!

   If you brought more than 1 Rollcall Orb, feel free to repeat steps 5-10 as
   often as you wish.

Q: I don't have any Rollcall Orbs or pokemon with the Illuminate ability!
   Any other ideas for getting lots of exp?
A: Here is a variant of the above method that uses Pokemon Traps instead of
   Rollcall Orbs and Illuminators to create monster houses.
   1. Add at least 15 of any Throwing item(s) to your bag.
   2. Make sure 1 of your pokemon has a room range damaging move, such as
      Discharge, Silver Wind, etc. Link it with another move.
   3. Add 1 or more Eyedrop Seeds to your bag.  Goggle Specs are better if
      have one.
   4. Enter any dungeon with Pokemon Traps in it, excluding the zero isles.
   5. Use your Eyedrop Seeds(or Goggle Specs) to find a Pokemon Trap.
   6. Place your Room-Range Move using Pokemon into the same room as the
      Pokemon Trap.
   7. Throw your Throwing items at the walls in the room.  Keep doing this
      until at least a dozen items litter the ground.
   8. Step on the Pokemon Trap to change every item in the room into an
      enemy Pokemon.
   9. Wipe the room clean using your room-range move. Enjoy the experience!
   10.Find another Pokemon Trap and repeat Steps 6-9 until satisfied.

Q: Forget all this Rollcall Orb and Pokemon Trap nonsense!  I want lots of
   experience, and I want it now!
A: Then here is my final trick for making your own monster houses.
   1. Place all your money and items into your bank and storage.
   2. Switch your leader to an extremely weak recruit.
   3. Go to a dungeon.
   4. Get yourself knocked out on floor 1, at your starting position.
   5. Choose to send an SOS Mail.
   6. At the main menu, get your SOS Mail via password and write it down.
   7. Revive yourself in defeat and then return to the main menu.
   8. Accept the SOS Mail you had written down.
   9. Head to your own rescue at Pelipper's Island.  Bring an Escape Orb.
  10. Wipe the monster house out. Enjoy the experience and Escape Orb out!

  Repeat steps 9 & 10 up to 10 times.  Afterward, if you are still not
  satisfied, repeat the whole process as many times as you want.  This is
  also a good way to get gummies and other items found in monster houses.

Q: What are the best dungeons to find Kecleon Shops in?
A: Star Cave.  Its early floors have a 50%/100% chance of having Kecleon
   Shops.  These kecleon shops don't have anything really special, but
   if you want to sell something to a kecleon shop, these are the easiest
   to find.  If you would rather recruit a Kecleon, then I recommend
   Waterfall Cave, Apple Woods, or Mt. Horn, which all have around 9%
   Kecleon Shop Appearance Rates, and don't have any difficult enemies.

Q: I need a lot of money! How can I get rich quick?
A: Stock up on Gold Ribbons/Lost Loots & Pure Seeds/Trawl Orbs.  Then bring
   these to the Kecleon Shops in Star Cave, and sell the GR/LLs there.
   Then use the PS/TOs to rob the Kecleon Shop and get all your items back.
   If you brought enough PS/TOs, you can repeat this multiple times on
   different floors of Star Cave.

Q: Any Advice for finding Hidden Stairs?
A: Eyedrop Seeds and Goggle Specs reveal Hidden Stairs.  Some 3-star pokemon
   items increase the chances of Hidden Stairs spawning.  You should
   definitely look for Hidden Stairs at Shaymin Village.  The Grab Bags
   in the Secret Bazaars there are incredibly good.  You can recycle for
   Eyedrop Seeds.

Q. What Post-ending dungeons have a lot of Pokemon Traps?
A. Pokemon Traps don't appear outstandingly frequently in any dungeon, but
   the best places to look for them are dungeons with a Trap Density of
   10 or higher in which Pokemon Traps have at least a 5% appearance rate.
   Some of the Wonder Dungeons, like Mt. Avalanche, Giant Volcano, and World
   Abyss, are good choices.

Q. What are Secret Rooms?
A. When you use Hidden Stairs, instead of going to the Secret Bazaar, there
   is a chance that you will instead end up in an empty room with 6 or so
   Deluxe Boxes in it.  This is a Secret Room.  The Deluxe Boxes found in
   a Secret Room hold random items found on the Swalot Grab Bag Item List
   for that Dungeon.  It seems that Secret Rooms can only appear in the
   post-ending dungeons with Hidden Stairs.  This excludes the 4 Rank
   dungeons.
