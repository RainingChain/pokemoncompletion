  "The hardest element is the Starf Berry which requires 203 consecutive Battle Subway wins. Check <a href=\"https://github.com/RainingChain/PokemonB2W2BattleSubwayRNG\">https://github.com/RainingChain/PokemonB2W2BattleSubwayRNG</a> for guidance for Battle Subway and Battle Institute.",
  "Join Avenue Level 100 is very long but it generates a lot of money. Add Market shops to your avenue and upon reaching level 10 on each shop, there will be a sale for 1 week. Buy all EV-items (ex: Protein) and sell them back to the Pokémart for about 2M $ profit. This can be repeated.",
  "Black Entralink Entree level 100 is also long. Best way to level it up is by doing the Find Lost Items! Lvl 1 funfest mission and going to Castelia. Make sure to get a score of at least 11. (Getting score of 10 gives 1 exp, while above 10 gives the score as exp.) You need about 5000 exp for lvl 100.",
  "Another long element is getting Pokérus (medal) but it can be RNG-abused.",
  "For the medal 10 Followers, you'll need to win 130+ times the musical. To win easily, do Stardom muscial and wear Cowboy Hat, Fake Belly Button, Black Wings, Toy Sword, Toy Cutlass, Fluffy Beard, Small Barrette, Pink Barrette. No need to appeal to win. Credits: Mikey_R",
  "Make sure to RNG the legendaries for perfect IV and nature, especially Latios and Terrakion which are very good for Battle Subway.",
  "If aiming for true 100%, you'll need to get all Pokémon forms, including all shiny forms. Make sure to RNG manipulate your secret trainer id when starting your new game."
