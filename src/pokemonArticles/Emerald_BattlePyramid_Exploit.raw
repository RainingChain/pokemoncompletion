<h2>Pokémon Emerald: Battle Pyramid Exploit</h2>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
How to get x99 Full Restore, x50 Sacred Ashes, and x50 Max Revive in the Battle Pyramid.
</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Scizor (Wing Attack, Cut, Metal Claw, Steel Wing) all with +3 PP Ups.</li>
  <li>x2 Pokémon with Pickup (ex: Aipom and Meowth)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Strategy</h3>
<ul>
  <li>In floor 7, fight wild Pokémon</li>
  <li>After each battle, check if a Pokémon found something with Pickup</li>
  <li>Use Leppa Berry, Max Ether and Max Elixir when needed.</li>
  <li>Repeat until you have 99 Max Elixir and 99 Full Restore</li>
  <li>Once your inventory is full, do the same on Floor 8 which gives Max Revive and Sacred Ashes (instead of Max Elixir).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Maths</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Scizor has 200 PP (~190 attacks taking into consideration accuracy).
     <ul>
      <li>100% Accuracy Wing Attack: 56</li>
      <li>95% Cut: ~45</li>
      <li>95% Metal Claw: ~53</li>
      <li>90% Steel Wing: 36</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    In average, every 190 battles, you will find from Pickup:
    <ul>
      <li>x1.9 Max Elixir (190 battles * 2 Pokémon with Pickup * 10% Pickup being triggered * 5% for Max Elixir)</li>
      <li>x3.8 Leppa Berry (190 battles * 2 Pokémon with Pickup * 10% Pickup being triggered * 10% for Leppa Berry)</li>
      <li>x3.8 Ether (190 battles * 2 Pokémon with Pickup * 10% Pickup being triggered * 10% for Ether)</li>
      <li>x1.9 Full Restore</li>
      <li>x11.4 Hyper Potion</li>
      <li>x3.8 Revive</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Advices</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Gulpin knows Protect. To avoid wasting PP, it's safer to run away from Gulpin. Gulpin can't damage Scizor.</li>
  <li>Scizor with Choice Band OHKO Butterfree and Roselia.</li>
  <li>Use Leftover when needed (when attack misses and Scizor gets damaged).</li>
</ul>
